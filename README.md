# Local Persistent Path Homology (LPPH) for Directed Link Prediction

This repository contains the official Python implementation of **Local Persistent Path Homology (LPPH)**, a novel topological feature vector designed for directed link prediction in graphs. The method is introduced in the thesis: 

> **Enhancing Machine Learning Algorithms on Directed Graphs Using Persistent Path Homology**  
> Sokolov Anton  

LPPH leverages **Persistent Path Homology (PPH)** to capture multi-scale directional topological features around graph edges. These features are transformed into fixed-dimensional vectors using **persistence images**, making them suitable for machine learning models.

## üß† What is LPPH?

LPPH is a topological feature extraction method that:

- Constructs an **edge-centric filtration** around a target directed edge.
- Computes **persistent path homology** to track the evolution of directed paths and cycles.
- Converts persistence diagrams into **persistence images**‚Äîstable, vectorized representations.
- Can be used **standalone** with classifiers like XGBoost or **integrated with GNNs** to enhance link prediction.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üß© **Direction-Aware**: Captures asymmetric connectivity patterns in directed graphs.
- üìê **Multi-Scale**: Extracts features at different filtration depths (e.g., 5, 9, 13, 17).
- üî¨ **Topologically Rich**: Encodes cycles, paths, and connectivity structures up to a chosen homology dimension.
- ‚ö° **Efficient**: Parallelized computation using PHAT for boundary matrix reduction.
- ü§ñ **Model-Agnostic**: Works with XGBoost, GNNs, or other classifiers.

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Standalone XGBoost with LPPH Features

```python
from LPPHboost import GraphLinkPredictor

predictor = GraphLinkPredictor(random_seed=0x57575757)
auc_scores = predictor.train_and_evaluate(
    dataset_name="caenorhabditis",
    edge_depth=5,
    dim=3,
    n_trials=30
)
```

### 2. Integrating LPPH with Directed GNNs

See `modelsPPH.ipynb` for full examples using:

- `DirGCNConv`
- `DirSageConv`
- `DirGATConv`

Example snippet:

```python
from features import compute_edge_features_parallel, ListDigraph
from models import LinkPredictionModel

# Compute LPPH features for edges
edge_features = compute_edge_features_parallel(
    graph, edges, max_depth=5, resolution=10, max_dim=3
)

# Use in a GNN model
model = LinkPredictionModel(
    type='dirGAT',
    in_feats=in_dim,
    gnn_hidden_size=hidden_dim,
    edge_feature_use=True,
    edge_emb_size=edge_feat_dim,
    fc_hidden_size=128,
    num_hidden_layers=2,
    gnn_layers=2
)
```

## üìà Results

LPPH improves link prediction performance:

- ‚úÖ Boosts dirGNNs in **10/11** datasets
- ‚úÖ Outperforms hybrid models in **8/11** datasets as a standalone XGBoost classifier
- ‚úÖ Competitive with state-of-the-art methods like SRTGCN and IRW/DRW

Example AUC improvements:
